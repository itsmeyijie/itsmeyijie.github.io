<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a final-year in the Department of Computing at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised by Prof. Dan Wang. Before that, I received my bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, in 2020 and 2022, respectively.  My research centered on the intersection of <p style="color:red">sustainable energy systems</p> and <font color="red">data-driven optimization under uncertainty</font>*. She focuses on developing carbon-aware operational strategies and robust optimization methods for energy systems to achieve low/net-zero emissions with \textcolor{red}{statistical guarantee}, specifically addressing challenges posed by forecasting uncertainties, leveraging data-driven and ML/DL techniques (e.g., conformal prediction), and robust optimization (e.g., chance-constrained, distributionally robust optimization).
